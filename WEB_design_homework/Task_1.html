            <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply <a href='http://www.dummymag.com/'>dummy text</a> of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
            <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
            <p> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages</p>
        <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of <em>classical</em> Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.<img src='https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQh1tee98SAsh1be9DlyngOOuMegSgGsd8tDgwAB1dsRpxA4Muh'/></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's a duck</li>
            <li>Yes it's a fuckin duck</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Richard McClintock</strong>, a Latin professor at <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampden%E2%80%93Sydney_College'style='text-decoration:none'>Hampden-Sydney College</a> in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
        <p> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <em>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"</em> (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</p>
